"""LEGACY — planner geometric spray latency compensation (offline/diagnostic only).

Production ownership: PathEngine preserves exact CAD PRE/MARK/AFT geometry
(compensate_spray=False). Runtime spray_controller owns distance-aware ON/OFF
anticipation (use_distance_aware_spray). Do not enable planner compensation on
production APIs, path_publisher_node, or mission staging — double compensation
would shift MARK geometry and anticipate boundaries twice.

When the solenoid opens, there's a delay before paint reaches the surface.
When it closes, there's a shorter delay before paint stops.

This module shifts the spray ON/OFF boundaries to compensate:
- Spray ON fires early (lead-in) so paint is flowing when the line starts
- Spray OFF fires early (lead-out) so paint stops when the line ends

Values are based on the marking_rover_core mission_generator defaults:
  spray_on_latency  = 0.10 s  (time for solenoid to fully open)
  spray_off_latency = 0.01 s  (time for solenoid to close — much shorter)
  marking_speed     = 0.35 m/s

Lead-in distance  = 0.10 × 0.35 = 0.035 m (3.5 cm)
Lead-out distance  = 0.01 × 0.35 = 0.0035 m (3.5 mm)
