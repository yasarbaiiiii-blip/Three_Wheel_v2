# DYX 3WD Marking Rover — Project Progress Log

Running log of all work. Each entry: what built, what fixed, what's next, time spent.

---

## 2026-06-15 — All 3 bug fixes VALIDATED; build stable

- **11-bag campaign (13-06)** via `tools/validate_build.py`: tracking excellent all shapes — arc 1.46 / lshape 0.90 / square 0.87 / U-turn 1.06 cm RMS (TRACKING). ulogs clean, no clipping, params consistent (RO_YAW_P=1.5, YAW_RATE_LIM=30, WENC=1).
- **BUG-T3 VALIDATED** — PASS on all 11 incl. ~90° mis-headed starts (init err +93/+87/+92°): correct turn, no reverse.
- **BUG-T2 VALIDATED** — U-turn flows continuously through tangent junction (0 stops, 0.97cm RMS).
- **BUG-T1 VALIDATED** — `square_2x2_20260615_144019`: pivots now clean single-direction spins, **1 significant yaw-rate reversal (>0.1) / 0 large** across 3 corners (was 8/2 on 06-13). xtrack 0.53cm RMS. Oscillation eliminated.
- Validator BUG-T1 heuristic recalibrated: count reversals >0.10 rad/s (sub-0.10 is settle-noise) — was over-counting (49 vs 8 real).
- Minor follow-up (optional): pivots ~6s (near 5s watchdog), 2/3 exit ~0.17 rad/s residual yaw — not blocking.
- **All 3 priority bugs CLOSED. Focus → path engine / CRS / spray (PE-T1..T5).**

---

## 2026-06-13 — BUG-T1/T2/T3 fixes committed

- **`1af51ac` `fix(rpp): BUG-T2 hard stops at smooth run/segment boundaries`** — eliminates stop-and-go at tangent junctions. Root cause = two forced stop-and-pivots: (1) `_apply_run` pivoted at every run boundary (`idx>0`) ignoring heading; (2) `_control_segment_profile` corner gate keyed off vehicle `heading_err` vs global frame → tracking noise on a straight junction tripped CORNER_STOP/ALIGN. Fix: `_apply_run` pivots only if prev-exit→new-entry heading Δ ≥ `segment_corner_threshold_deg`; transition gate now uses path-intrinsic `_segment_angle_deg` (below threshold → advance without dropping velocity). Hard corners unchanged. Pending live RTK validation (U-turn).
- **`036f116` `fix(rpp): BUG-T1 corner-pivot oscillation — yaw-rate settle gates`** — CORNER_STOP joint speed+yaw-rate AND gate; CORNER_ALIGN exit needs heading+yaw-rate stable for `segment_align_settle_s`=0.10s; new params `segment_stop_yaw_rate_threshold`=0.05; `segment_debug` 9→10 fields (`[9]`=actual yaw-rate NED). Pending bag validation. **Note:** Opus's "RO_YAW_RATE_LIM 90→35" firmware action is moot — already 30 (validated log_183).
- **`510be9b` `fix(rpp): forward-cone clamp on first-segment velocity`** — BUG-T3 resolved: rover no longer turns the wrong way / drives reverse when start heading opposes the first segment.
- Deploy: fast-forward pull on Jetson → `rpp-pipeline` restart (2 s, MAVROS intact) → 3/3 services active, no tracebacks, API ping OK. Three-way sync Mac == origin == Jetson @ `510be9b`. ✓
- Also live: auto rosbag recorder (`bag-autorecord.service`) — captures every API-started mission to `~/bags_jet`.
- **Next:** BUG-T1 (stop-pivot corner oscillation/jerk) — now active focus.

---

## 2026-06-12 — Controller + Tuning Phase CLOSED; pivot to path/spray/pipeline

### Milestone: tracking validated, controller work frozen
- **Square (segment / stop-pivot profile) — FIELD VALIDATED.** Bag `square_cornerfix_20260612_201142` (~2m sides, full loop, 55.9s):
  - RPP cross-track (TRACKING): **mean 0.34 / RMS 0.52 / p95 1.11 / max 1.45 cm**
  - Independent geometric x-track (point-to-polyline): **mean 0.66 / RMS 0.82 / p95 1.58 / max 2.17 cm** (max = corner cusp, not straights)
  - Stop-pivot corner FSM exercised all states (TRACK_SEGMENT→PRE_CORNER_SLOWDOWN→CORNER_ALIGN→CORNER_STOP→TRACK). Heading tracks target cleanly after each pivot.
  - **Corner-xtrack goal ≤5cm: MET (~2cm).** Lines run ~0.5cm; corners handled by stop-and-pivot, so no curvature-following error.
- **Arc (smooth RPP) — at structural floor, DEFERRED (not on critical path).**
  - Best run `arc_fix_01_20260609_173519`: RMS 2.09 / max 3.47 cm. `arc_fix_02_173805`: RMS 2.76 cm. 06-08 ref `arc_fix_01`: 2.57cm median / 6.3cm peak.
  - NOT robust: `arc_fix_03_173922` (12.6cm RMS) and `arc_fix_04_174210` (15.7cm RMS, didn't finish) diverged/oscillated when gains were pushed. `arc_fix_01_173313` was an aborted run (no `/path`, state stayed RTK_WAIT=4).
  - Summary verdict: smooth arcs are under 3cm RMS in the validated config but peak >3cm and aren't reliable; the segment profile is the production path.

### Root cause analysis (ulog `log_42` + fork source) — why smooth arcs floor at ~2-3cm
- OFFBOARD runs in **velocity mode**. `DifferentialOffboardMode::offboardControl()` velocity branch sets `speed = |vel|`, `yaw_setpoint = atan2f(vE,vN)`, and **discards `trajectory_setpoint.yawspeed`** (RPP's `/rpp/yaw_rate_body` FF). yawspeed is only piped through in `body_rate` mode.
- Attitude loop (`DifferentialAttControl` → `RoverControl::attitudeControl`) is **pure-P**: `pid_yaw.setGains(RO_YAW_P, 0, 0)`, no feedforward. On a curve the yaw setpoint ramps at ω, so steady following error = `ω/RO_YAW_P = 0.23/1.0 = 13°`. Measured heading lag = **12.0° ± 2.2°** (matches), pinned across all 06-09 runs regardless of companion-side changes.
- **No saturation/clipping anywhere** (ulog): actuator_motors peak 0.40/1.0, normalized_speed_diff 0.08/0.95, yaw-accel slew not active, rate-loop meas/cmd ≈ 1.04, integrals ~0. Error is a heading-loop gain/architecture issue, not headroom.
- Speed loop overshoots (~0.42 vs 0.35 cmd) + decel lag from soft `RO_SPEED_P=0.18/I=0.02`; absorbed by CORNER_STOP dwell on the square.
- **Correction to prior session's claim:** the earlier "PX4 under-delivers yaw rate / use `yaw_rate_feedback_gain`" idea is wrong — in velocity mode PX4 ignores RPP's body yaw rate entirely. To beat 2cm on smooth curves: raise `RO_YAW_P` (QGC, source of truth) OR switch offboard to `body_rate` mode so RPP's yaw rate drives the rate loop directly. Deferred — segment profile already meets the target.

### Tooling
- Bag analyser confirmed: `tools/analysis/analyze_arc_bag.py <bagdir>` (reads `/rpp/debug` idx 0/1/3/4/7, TRACKING-only metrics + PNG).
- New: `bags/12-06-2026/square_cornerfix_20260612_201142/analyze_square.py` — commanded-vs-actual figures (path, yaw heading+rate, speed w/ corner-phase shading, error+state timeline) + independent geometric cross-track. Outputs `fig1_path / fig2_yaw / fig3_speed / fig4_error`.

### Next (Phase 3 — controller done, focus shifts)
1. **Path engine + trajectory planning** — mission/path generation, per-entity segment splitting, corner handling, resample/smooth
2. **CRS / coordinate handling** — coordinate reference system + geodesic conversion for path import (DXF/QGC → local NED)
3. **Spray control logic** — validate flag conditioning, timing, safety gates end-to-end (still pending hw: AUX 301, solenoid wiring, cmd 187 bench, latency)
4. **Full-pipeline validation** — CAD/DXF → path → mission → drive → spray, on hardware

### Status audit vs codebase (2026-06-12) — closed stale "pending" tasks
- **Spray software is BUILT + tested**, not pending: z-channel flag transport (`ros_node.py`, `path_publisher_node.py`, RPP `:555`), flag carry-through in `_smooth_corners`/`_resample_path`/`_simplify_path_for_profile` with boundary AND-rule (test: `test_spray_flag_conditioning.py`), `spray_controller` wired in prod launcher `rpp_start.sh` + dead `rpp_pipeline.launch.py`, server `marking_state` (models/main/telemetry), and `test_spray_manual_override.py` (9 tests: debounce, disarm/not-OFFBOARD reject, watchdog, staleness, failsafe precedence, shutdown→OFF). Tracker P3-T3/T4/T5/T6/T9/T10 → **Done**. Remaining spray = hardware/bench/QGC only (P3-T1/T2/T8/T11/T12) + frontend pill (P3-T7).
- **Encoder fusion DONE via EKF2 wheel-encoder fusion** (validated log_150). robot_localization sprint **superseded** — no STM32 bridge, no ROS2 EKF node. Tracker S2-T7/T8 → Superseded, S2-T9 → Done, I-T1 → Superseded.
- ⚠ **Open caveat:** 12-06 param snapshot `init.params` still shows `EKF2_WENC_CTRL=0` / `RBCLW_COUNTS_REV=1200` (pre-fix). Confirm the live FCU carries the validated `CTRL=1` / `COUNTS_REV=148000` before relying on fusion.
- `rpp_pipeline.launch.py` confirmed **dead code** (services use `rpp_start.sh`) — I-T2 cleanup still valid.

---

## 2026-06-11 — Codebase/Tracker Audit

### Current source-of-truth updates
- `/rpp/debug` is currently a 47-field append-only payload. Legacy consumers should keep reading stable indices `0..7`; spray/profile fields live at `39..46`.
- Phase 3 spray software is implemented in this repo: path z-channel flags, RPP conditioned geometry on `/rpp/conditioned_path`, spray-controller timing/flow/safety ownership, `/spray/active` as telemetry/legacy fallback, launch/service wiring, `/api/spray/*`, and `marking_state` telemetry.
- Remaining spray blockers are hardware/QGC/bench validation: AUX function 301 config, solenoid/driver wiring, command 187 bench test, latency measurement, and real fail-safe validation.
- Sensor fusion remains blocked by hardware and code: there is no `localization_node.py`, `robot_localization.yaml`, `/wheel_odom` bridge, or RPP `/odom` subscriber in the current codebase.

## 2026-05-15 — Phase 1 Start (3 sessions)

### Built
- PX4 v1.16.2 firmware built and flashed to CubeOrangePlus
- Generic Rover Differential airframe configured (SYS_AUTOSTART=50000)
- Motor outputs mapped: PWM_MAIN_FUNC1=102 (Right), PWM_MAIN_FUNC3=101 (Left)
- RC setup: R8EF v1.6 SBUS, tank mode two-paddle
- MAVROS2 connection established on Jetson via USB serial

### Fixed
- Bug 1: RO_YAW_RATE_LIM=0.87 was deg/s not rad/s → rover never moved in AUTO
- Bug 2: CA_R_REV=3 confirmed correct (bidirectional PWM, not direction flag)
- Bug 3: Waypoint never accepted → firmware fix ecf1d7b5 (mission_block.cpp rover bypass)
- Bug 4: QGC shows "flying" → RoverLandDetector always returns grounded (firmware fix)

### Next
- Fix IK sign reversal (Bug 5)
- Fix throttle sign (Bug 6)
- Begin PID tuning for straight-line AUTO

---

## 2026-05-18 — ArduRover Abandoned (1 session)

### Decision
- Full pivot from ArduRover to PX4+ROS2
- GPL-3 license blocks commercial sale
- ArduRover cannot draw arcs (NAV_LOITER_TURNS only does full circles, densified WPs is the only partial arc method)
- `~/ardupilot/` on Jetson declared dead weight

### Built
- Multi-AI architecture review process started (ChatGPT, Grok, Claude)

---

## 2026-05-19 — Phase 1 Complete (4 sessions)

### Built
- Firmware bug 5 (IK signs) fixed in commit 62619611 (RoverDifferential.cpp)
- Physical wiring fix applied for bug 6 (throttle sign)
- GPS_YAW_OFFSET=180 + IK sign fix confirmed correct orientation
- AUTO mode now works with nose-first motion
- PX4 PID baseline tuning achieved:
  - RO_YAW_RATE_P=0.5, RO_YAW_RATE_I=0.3, RO_YAW_RATE_LIM=30.0
  - RO_SPEED_P=0.5, RO_SPEED_I=0.1
  - NAV_ACC_RAD=0.1, MIS_YAW_ERR=25.0
- Log evidence: NAV_ACC_RAD=0.1 gives xtrack avg=0.006m (best)

### Fixed
- All 6 firmware bugs resolved
- Wiring fix resolved physical direction issues

### Next
- Production-harden runtime stack (systemd, NTRIP, service)
- Begin architecture review for Phase 2

---

## 2026-05-20 — Phase 1.5 Complete (3 sessions)

### Built
- `ntrip_rtcm_node.py` — full rewrite with 20+ fixes:
  - CRC-24Q validation on every RTCM3 frame (discard corrupt)
  - Reserved bits soft-check (warns but proceeds for non-compliant casters)
  - GGA send failure suppression counter (3 warns then silent)
  - `_gga_lock` threading.Lock for `_gga_sock` race condition
  - NavSatStatus constants corrected (STATUS_GBAS_FIX / STATUS_SBAS_FIX)
  - QoS: BEST_EFFORT depth=10 (was RELIABLE depth=1)
  - Health monitoring: 30s timer, reconnect counter
  - Exponential backoff: min(5×2^attempt, 60), interruptible
- `px4_start_service.sh` — production hardening:
  - NTRIP_SCRIPT derived from SCRIPT_DIR (inside repo)
  - `ntrip_watchdog()` with own TERM/INT trap, restart loop
  - Env var validation before NTRIP watchdog start
  - Log rotation at startup if >10MB
  - `free_port()` graceful: SIGTERM first, SIGKILL only if needed
  - Named timing constants (no magic numbers)
  - FCU validation: `ros2 topic echo /mavros/state --once --timeout 5`
  - pkill patterns fixed: "mavros.*node.launch" + "ntrip_rtcm_node"
- `px4-dxp.service` — hardened systemd unit:
  - BindsTo=dev-ttyACM0.device, After=dev-ttyACM0.device
  - ProtectSystem=strict, ReadWritePaths narrowed
  - EnvironmentFile uncommented (deploy.sh creates env file)
  - WatchdogSec commented out (needs sd_notify, not yet implemented)
  - CPUQuota=400% (4 cores for Phase 2)
- `deploy.sh` — symlink-based deployment:
  - Symlinks systemd service → /etc/systemd/system/
  - Symlinks logrotate config → /etc/logrotate.d/
  - Creates NTRIP env file (prompts once, skips if exists)
  - Reloads systemd daemon + enables service
  - --restart flag for immediate service restart
- `ntrip.logrotate` — daily rotation, 7-day retain, 10MB max, copytruncate
- `px4_pluginlists_rover.yaml` — 10 denied plugins with inline comments + gps_rtk intent note
- `docs/MAVROS_vs_DDS.md` — MAVROS2 vs uXRCE-DDS comparison
- `docs/Pure_DDS.md` — Pure DDS architecture + migration path
- `docs/Architecture/FINAL_ARCHITECTURE.md` — consolidated final architecture
- `docs/Progress/PROGRESS.md` — this file

### Fixed
- All 20+ bugs from audit + Kiro review resolved
- NTRIP_SCRIPT path ordering bug (SCRIPT_DIR must be defined before NTRIP_SCRIPT references it)
- Stale comment "depth=1" in ntrip_rtcm_node.py QoS (now depth=10)
- .gitignore: ntrip_rtcm_node.py stays in version control (credentials via env vars)

### Design decisions
- All runtime files inside `~/PX4_DXP/` (git repo) — no scattered files outside
- System files symlinked by deploy.sh — git pull auto-updates, just restart service
- NTRIP node inside repo — old `~/ntrip_rtcm_node.py` is dead
- NTRIP credentials in `~/.config/ntrip/env` (not in repo, created by deploy.sh)

### Next
- Deploy to Jetson: `git pull && rm ~/ntrip_rtcm_node.py && ./deploy.sh --restart`
- Phase 2: ROS2 Offboard control node
- OFFBOARD mode: stream setpoints ≥2Hz → arm → mode switch
- First milestone: velocity setpoint → straight-line motion

---

## 2026-05-20 — Phase 2 Prep (1 session)

### Built
- OFFBOARD audit complete (Kiro Opus): 3 firmware bugs found, 4 patches specified
- MAVROS2-only architecture decision finalized (DDS shelved)
- Full stack license audit: all permissive, zero GPL contamination
- Architecture docs committed: MAVROS2_ONLY_DECISION.md, LICENSE_AUDIT.md, KIRO_OPUS_OFFBOARD_AUDIT_PROMPT.md
- CubeOrangePlus port map verified from param files (TELEM2 free for future DDS)

### Fixed
- Identified OFFBOARD bug #1: velocity sign lost (`velocity.norm()` always positive, can't reverse)
- Identified OFFBOARD bug #2: North-snap at zero velocity (`atan2f(0,0)=0`, rover yaws to North on stop)
- Identified OFFBOARD bug #3: latent runaway on OFFBOARD exit (cached position setpoint never NaN-invalidated)
- Identified OFFBOARD bug #4: no was_armed guard in RoverDifferential (one-cycle motor linger on disarm)
- Corrected #18346 analysis: POSCTL fallback goes through manualPositionMode (reads RC stick = zero → safe stop), NOT goToPositionMode. Bug is latent, not active.

### Next
- Set FCU safety params (COM_OBL_RC_ACT=5, COM_OF_LOSS_T=0.3, COM_RCL_EXCEPT=4, RD_TANK_MODE=0)
- Apply firmware patches P1-P4 to PX4 fork
- Extend build_rover.yml to copy VelControl + PosControl files
- Push fork, CI build, flash to CubeOrangePlus
- Start Phase 2: write OFFBOARD ROS2 node on Jetson

## 2026-05-20 — Phase 2 Start: OFFBOARD Patches Applied (1 session)

### Built
- Firmware patches P1-P4 committed and pushed to fork (commit 1e2ce81a)
  - P1: DifferentialPosControl — NaN-invalidate cached position on OFFBOARD exit + disarm
  - P2: RoverDifferential — _was_armed guard, zero actuator on disarm, slew-rate reset
  - P3: DifferentialVelControl — signed speed projection (body-x axis) for reverse motion
  - P4: DifferentialVelControl — hold-yaw-at-stop (freeze _vehicle_yaw when vel < 0.01 m/s)
- DifferentialVelControl directory created in fork (was missing from overlay)
- build_rover.yml extended: now copies VelControl (.cpp/.hpp/CMakeLists.txt) + PosControl (.cpp/.hpp)
- CI build triggered on push to main

### Next
- Monitor CI build at https://github.com/Vetri2425/PX4-Autopilot/actions
- Download firmware artifact, flash to CubeOrangePlus
- Set 13 FCU params in QGC (safety + performance)
- Begin OFFBOARD ROS2 node on Jetson (Phase 2 milestone 1: straight-line velocity)

## Phase 2 Entries Start Below

## 2026-05-20 — Phase 2 Session 5: RPP Pipeline Built (1 session)

### Built
- **rpp_controller_node.py** (~577 lines) — Regulated Pure Pursuit controller
  - Outputs **NED velocity vector** (Vector3Stamped on /rpp/velocity_ned), NOT body-frame (v, ω)
  - PX4 derives yaw from atan2(vE, vN) in DifferentialOffboardMode — no ω command needed
  - Segment projection (not vertex search) for closest-point on path
  - Curvature-regulated speed: slows on tight curves, full speed on straights
  - Approach scaling: linear deceleration in last 0.6m to goal
  - P4 zero-vel floor: below 2 cm/s, set speed=0 to trigger heading-hold
  - Pose freshness check: stale >200ms → emergency stop (0,0,0), OFFBOARD stays alive
  - Publishes /rpp/debug (was 39 fields at this point; current 2026-06-11 layout is 47 fields)
  - No rotate-to-heading FSM — PX4 spot-turn handles large heading errors (RD_TRANS_DRV_TRN)
- **twist_to_setpoint_node.py** (~231 lines) — MAVROS OFFBOARD heartbeat bridge
  - 50Hz PositionTarget stream, FRAME_LOCAL_NED, velocity + explicit yaw by default
  - Uses type_mask 455 when fresh yaw-rate feedforward is active, otherwise 2503
  - Input already in NED — no body→NED transform needed (RPP outputs NED)
  - Stale input (>200ms) → zero velocity (safe fail-stop, OFFBOARD stays live)
  - NaN/Inf rejection on input
- **path_publisher_node.py** (~185 lines) — Test paths
  - straight_5m, arc_quarter_1m5, lshape_2x2
  - TRANSIENT_LOCAL durability, frame_id validation
- **xtrack_logger_node.py** (~269 lines) — 20Hz CSV logger
  - 18 columns: t, pose, xtrack, heading_err, speed, κ, state, velocity, MAVROS setpoint
  - Flushes every ~1s for crash resilience
- **mission_runner_node.py** (~350 lines) — OFFBOARD lifecycle state machine
  - INIT → WAIT_FCU → WAIT_STREAM → SWITCH_OFFBOARD → ARM → RUNNING → DISARM → MANUAL → FINISHED
  - 5Hz tick, mission timeout (5 min default), external OFFBOARD exit detection
  - Dry run mode for telemetry capture without arming
  - Monitors /rpp/debug state_code for DONE detection
- **launch/rpp_pipeline.launch.py** (~169 lines) — Ordered startup
  - twist_to_setpoint first (heartbeat), rpp_controller second, path_publisher after 2s
  - auto_run flag: mission_runner after 4s (OFFBOARD + arm)
  - dry_run flag: skip arm/mode commands

### Key architectural change from original T3 spec
- Original spec: RPP outputs body-frame (v, ω) → twist_to_setpoint does body→NED rotation
- Built system: RPP outputs NED velocity vector → twist_to_setpoint just wraps in PositionTarget
- Reason: PX4 v1.16 DifferentialOffboardMode computes `bearing = atan2(vE, vN)` from velocity vector direction. It ignores yaw/yaw_rate in the setpoint. Sending ω would be pointless.
- PX4's internal spot-turn FSM (RD_TRANS_DRV_TRN ≈ 30° → spot-turn, RD_TRANS_TRN_DRV ≈ 5° → resume driving) handles large heading errors automatically.

### Research task status
- T1 (Mission Formats) — TODO
- T2 (Trajectory Planning) — TODO
- T3 (Controller Pipeline) — **COMPLETE** (code written, not yet tested)
- T4 (Sensor Fusion) — TODO
- T5 (RPP Arc Controller) — **MERGED INTO T3**
- T6 (Full System Architecture) — TODO

### Next (pre-hardware checklist, in order)
1. Run Motion Studio autotune → get RBCLW_QPPS_MAX value
2. Add SER_TEL2_BAUD = 115200 to param file
3. Flash firmware with RoboClaw QPPS patch
4. Verify both motors spin forward with positive command
5. Fix NTRIP → validate RTK → retest velocity mode
6. SITL validation of RPP pipeline (Gazebo + PX4 SITL)
7. Hardware bring-up with RTK (straight line → arc → L-shape)
8. Research T1/T2/T4 for Phase 3 (CAD → mission pipeline)

---

## 2026-05-20 — Phase 2 Session 4: Research & Architecture (1 session)

### Built
- Research tasks T1-T6 created in `docs/Researches/COMMERCIAL_ROVER_RESEARCH/`
- T3 Controller Pipeline synthesis completed (multi-AI research: ChatGPT, Gemini, GLM, Grok + primary sources)
- T3 FINAL_SYNTHESIS.md: RPP on Jetson, velocity setpoints only, MAVROS2 only, no Nav2 stack
- RoboClaw driver patch (Kiro Opus): open-loop duty → closed-loop velocity QPPS (opcodes 35/36)
- Param file `Param_with_Roboclaw.params` created with RoboClaw params + safety params

### Decisions from T3 synthesis
1. **RPP (Regulated Pure Pursuit)** on Jetson — NOT Stanley, NOT MPC
2. **Velocity setpoints only** (type_mask 3527) — position setpoints stack two pure-pursuit controllers = oscillation
3. **MAVROS2 only** — uXRCE-DDS rover offboard broken (forum bug 48430, unresolved)
4. **No Nav2 stack** — overkill for marking with no obstacles
5. **Custom rpp_controller_node.py** (~200 lines) + **twist_to_setpoint_node.py**
6. Build order: RPP node → twist_to_setpoint → path source → logger → SITL → hardware

### RoboClaw driver update
- **Opus patch applied**: `setMotorSpeed()` now sends QPPS velocity commands (opcodes 35/36) instead of duty (opcodes 0/1/4/5)
- **RBCLW_QPPS_MAX = 0** in param file — **CRITICAL**: must be set from Motion Studio autotune, 0 = no motion
- **SER_TEL2_BAUD missing** — must be added (recommend 115200, must match RoboClaw config)
- PWM_MAIN_FUNC1-8 all set to 0 (motors moved from PWM to RoboClaw)
- CA_R_REV = 3 still applies (control allocator reversal before driver)

### Open issues
- **RBCLW_QPPS_MAX** — must be measured with Motion Studio autotune before flashing
- **SER_TEL2_BAUD** — must be added to param file (115200 recommended)
- **P3 (reverse motion)** — not validated without RTK
- **P4 (heading hold)** — not validated without RTK
- **NTRIP server 502** — external issue, blocks RTK testing

### Next
- Run Motion Studio autotune → get RBCLW_QPPS_MAX value
- Add SER_TEL2_BAUD = 115200 to param file
- Flash firmware with RoboClaw QPPS patch
- Test RoboClaw motor direction (both forward with positive command)
- Fix NTRIP → validate RTK → retest velocity mode
- Build rpp_controller_node.py (can write code now, test later with RTK)

---

## 2026-05-21 — Phase 2 Session 6: FastAPI Backend Server Built (1 session)

### Built
- **FastAPI backend server** (17 files, ~2500 lines) in `PX4_DXP/server/`
  - `main.py` — FastAPI app factory with lifespan, Socket.IO mount, 10Hz telemetry loop with watchdog
  - `ros_node.py` — Single rclpy node in background thread with MultiThreadedExecutor (4 threads)
    - Subscribes to 7 MAVROS/RPP topics (state, pose, battery, GPS, RPP debug, RPP velocity)
    - Publishes `/path` topic (TRANSIENT_LOCAL QoS for late-joining subscribers)
    - Service clients for arm/disarm, set_mode, param get/set
    - ENU→NED conversion for pose and heading
    - Async service wrappers (`arm_async`, `set_mode_async`, `get_param_async`, `set_param_async`) using `call_async` + `add_done_callback`
    - MAVROS process-crash detection: `_state_recv_time` timeout overrides TRANSIENT_LOCAL cached `connected=True`
  - `offboard_controller.py` — Async OFFBOARD lifecycle state machine
    - States: IDLE → ARMING → SWITCHING_OFFBOARD → RUNNING → STOPPING → IDLE (COMPLETED, ABORTED branches)
    - Pre-flight checks: FCU connected, RPP not STALE
    - OFFBOARD pre-stream grace period (0.5s delay before path publish)
    - `publish_stop_path()` — publishes single-point path at rover's current position (empty Path ignored by RPP)
    - Async lock on lifecycle calls to prevent concurrent arm/mode-switch
  - `path_manager.py` — Path loading (6 built-in generators + QGC .waypoints + CSV)
    - `lru_cache` on builtin generators for fast repeated access
    - Upload validation: extension whitelist (.waypoints, .csv), 1MiB size limit
    - Karney geodesic conversion for QGC WPL 110 format (same method as path_publisher_node)
  - `rpp_status.py` — RPP debug array decoder with done-settle detection (1.0s default)
  - `emergency.py` — Async e-stop: stop-path + MANUAL mode + disarm (3-step chain with per-step error handling)
  - `beacon.py` — UDP broadcast for LAN discovery (port 5002, every 2s)
  - `auth.py` — Shared-secret token auth (`~/.rover_token`, auto-generated, `ROVER_DISABLE_AUTH=1` to bypass)
  - `logging_setup.py` — Structured logging with ISO-8601 timestamps
  - `config.py` — All constants centralized: topic names, service names, QoS profiles, safety thresholds
  - `models.py` — Pydantic v2 request/response models with typed enums
  - Routes (6 modules): system, vehicle, mission, path, params, telemetry — all auth-protected except telemetry and ping
  - Socket.IO events: arm, set_mode, emergency_stop, mission_load/start/stop/abort, request_params — all auth-protected
  - Telemetry loop (10Hz): pushes telemetry + mission_status via Socket.IO, auto-completes on RPP DONE, auto-aborts on pose stale/disconnect

### Key architecture decisions
- **Pure rclpy** (no roslibpy, no CLI fallback) — server runs on same Jetson as ROS2 nodes
- **Async service calls** — `call_async` + `add_done_callback` + `loop.call_soon_threadsafe`, never blocks FastAPI event loop
- **MultiThreadedExecutor(4)** — prevents callback starvation from service calls blocking subscriptions
- **Token auth** — shared secret, auto-generated, bypass with env var for dev/LAN-only
- **Stop-path instead of empty Path** — RPP node ignores empty Path (early return), so e-stop publishes single point at rover's current position

### API endpoints

## 2026-05-20 — Phase 2 Sessions 1-3: OFFBOARD Test Node (1 session)

### Built
- `src/offboard_test.py` — OFFBOARD test node with two modes:
  - **Position mode** (Session 2): 1m North in NED, hold, stop, disarm
  - **Velocity mode** (Session 3): forward 0.3 m/s → stop → reverse -0.3 m/s → stop → hold → disarm
  - 50Hz setpoint stream, 1s preflight, OFFBOARD mode confirmation, auto-disarm on exit
  - STATUSTEXT subscription for FCU denial reasons
  - ExtendedState subscription for landed state / system status
  - Mode reset to MANUAL before OFFBOARD (prevents stale state from previous test)
- Position mode: **WORKING** — armed, drove toward NED target, disarmed
- Velocity mode forward: **WORKING** — both motors same direction after ENU→NED fix
- Velocity mode reverse: **NOT WORKING** — P3 not active, rover spot-turns instead of reversing
- Jetson + laptop PX4_DXP repos synced (both at commit `dd2a134`)

### Fixed
- **Bug: FRAME_BODY_OFFSET_NED (9) rejected** — PX4 rover firmware error `coordinate frame 9 unsupported`. Fix: use FRAME_LOCAL_NED (1) + body→NED velocity transform in node code
- **Bug: ENU→NED yaw 90° error** — MAVROS `/mavros/local_position/pose` publishes quaternions in ENU frame (0°=East, CCW). Code was using ENU yaw as NED yaw (0°=North, CW), rotating all velocity setpoints 90° off heading. Fix: `yaw_NED = π/2 - yaw_ENU`
- **Bug: Arming denied without stable heading** — NTRIP server 502 → no RTK → heading estimate unstable → PX4 refuses arm (ERROR, not WARN). COM_ARM_WO_GPS=1 does NOT bypass heading stability check. Workaround: disable GPS preflight check in QGC
- **Bug: Stale OFFBOARD mode from previous test** — shutdown tried HOLD (rover doesn't have HOLD). Fix: switch to MANUAL on shutdown; reset to MANUAL before starting OFFBOARD sequence
- **Bug: Double disarm race condition** — shutdown handler fires before state callback updates. Harmless but noisy.

### Open issues
- **P3 (reverse motion) not working in OFFBOARD** — PX4 rover velocity controller interprets negative speed as "turn 180° and drive forward" instead of "drive backward." P3 patch should fix this but appears NOT active in OFFBOARD velocity control path. Need to verify: is commit `24d78a81` actually flashed? Does P3 apply in OFFBOARD mode?
- **P4 (heading hold at stop) NOT validated** — heading too unstable without RTK to test
- **Throttle ramp slow** — 60% throttle produced only 0.01 m/s in 3s. Acceleration limiting (RO_ACCEL_LIM) causes gradual ramp. Not hardware.
- **NTRIP server down** — external 502 Bad Gateway, no RTCM corrections flowing
- **13 safety params NOT set on FCU** — COM_OF_LOSS_T, COM_OBL_RC_ACT, COM_RCL_EXCEPT, RD_TANK_MODE, etc.

### Next
- **Fix NTRIP** (external server issue) → RTK corrections → stable heading → retest velocity mode
- **Verify P3 firmware** — is commit `24d78a81` actually flashed on CubeOrangePlus?
- **Set safety params** on FCU via QGC
- **Session 4**: Pure-pursuit arc controller node (can write code now, test with RTK later)

## 2026-05-22 — Phase 2 Session 7+8: Sprint 1+2+Phase B Complete (2 sessions)

**2026-05-22: Reverted RoboClaw boot-timing (617cce5a), completed Sprint 1+2 (P0.1-P0.3, P1.1-P1.4, 5 polish), Phase B (debug expansion, RTK_WAIT/JUMP_SKIP state codes, single-pass curvature walker). 15/15 tests pass, 9 files touched.**

### Built
- **Firmware**: Reverted RoboClaw boot-timing retry commit (bfe914ce → 617cce5a). Downloaded CI artifact to `PX4_Firmware/Revert_Boot_Timing_617cce5a/`. Driver still dies on cold boot — manual `roboclaw stop && start` required until root cause is fixed.
- **Sprint 1 — rpp_controller_node.py** (4 changes):
  - P0.1: Closed-loop L_d — `v_for_ld = max(min_v, _last_speed_cmd)` instead of constant `max_v * 0.5`
  - P0.2: EKF position-jump guard — skip cycle if position jumps > `ekf_jump_threshold_m` (default 5cm), reset segment hint
  - P0.3: RTK FIX gate — subscribe to `/mavros/gpsstatus/gps1/raw`, refuse motion if `fix_type < 6` and `require_rtk_fix=true`
  - P1.4: Segment search hint — `_project_onto_path` uses 6-segment window, `_hint_valid` forces full O(n) scan after path/jump reset
- **Sprint 1 Polish** (5 commits, same file):
  1. Dead `dt_s` removed
  2. P0.1 bootstrap comment fixed (min_v → max_v * 0.5)
  3. `_hint_valid` full-scan flag on first cycle
  4. `RTK_WAIT=4`, `JUMP_SKIP=5` enum values reserved
  5. `_check_threshold_compat()` boot-time warning if threshold too tight for max speed
- **Sprint 2 — Geometry upgrades** (same file):
  - P1.1: Predictive curvature regulation — `preview_curvature_n` (default 3), Menger κ across N preview points
  - P1.2: Adaptive lookahead — `xtrack_lookahead_gain` (default 1.0), `L_d = clamp(k_v·v + k_e·|e⊥|, L_min, L_max)`
  - P1.3: Path conditioning — `path_resample_spacing_m`, `corner_smooth_radius_m`, `corner_smooth_arc_pts` (all opt-in, default 0=off)
- **Phase B — Observability + Perf** (9 files):
  - B1+: `/rpp/debug` expanded to 39 fields in this historical entry. Current 2026-06-11 layout is 47 fields: `[0..7]` remain append-only/stable, `[8..10]` add lookahead/curvature/yaw-rate observability, `[11..38]` snapshot active RPP parameters, and `[39..46]` carry spray/profile state.
  - B2: `RTK_WAIT=4` and `JUMP_SKIP=5` state codes replace `STALE=-1` for GPS-gate and EKF-jump cases. All 5 consumers updated: `config.py` (RPP_UNHEALTHY_CODES={-1,4,5}), `models.py` (Literal extended), `main.py` (watchdog uses set), `offboard_controller.py` (start guard with code-specific messages), `mission_runner_node.py` (throttled warns per code). Dependency order: consumers first, producer last.
  - B3: Single-pass `_walk_path_samples()` replaces N×O(P) walks in `_max_preview_curvature`. ~7.5× speedup at N=3. Bit-exact verified (Test 14: max diff = 0.00e+00).
- **Tests**: `test_sprint2_geometry.py` — 15 offline geometry tests, all pass. Covers: resample, smooth_corners, Menger κ, predictive κ integration, `_hint_valid` projection (full-scan, hint walk, stale-hint regression), single-pass walker bit-exact verification.

### Fixed
- RoboClaw boot-timing retry reverted — retry mechanism masked the real issue (UART ACK timeout on cold boot)
- Overloaded STALE state code split into RTK_WAIT and JUMP_SKIP for observability
- Segment hint race condition closed — `_hint_valid` flag forces full scan after path/jump reset

### Phase C Audit (Kiro, same session)
GLM-5.1 shipped Phase C (C1 RT scheduling, C2 velocity extrapolation under the legacy `use_imu_extrapolation` parameter, P0.5 explicit yaw, P3.1 feedforward yaw rate). Kiro found **7 bugs**, all fixed before field test:
1. Duplicate `_yaw_pub` publisher (cosmetic)
2. Duplicate `_latest_accel`/`_imu_recv_time` orphan state (cosmetic + dead state)
3. **IMU acceleration path included gravity** (`/mavros/imu/data`); dropped dominant `v·dt` term — **wrong-direction performance** → P2.4 rewritten to velocity-based (`/mavros/local_position/velocity_local`)
4. Pose freshness tripped STALE before extrapolation ran — negated P2.4 feature → reordered
5. `CPUQuota=400%` ignored under SCHED_FIFO; FIFO grant depended on limits.conf → added `LimitRTPRIO=99`, removed `CPUQuota`
6. **`NameError` in `_publish_yaw_rate`** — references undefined `v_n`/`v_e` every cycle → **runtime crash on every control cycle** (would kill OFFBOARD within 500ms)
7. Docstring said "does NOT compute ω" but P3.1 added ω publisher → updated

**Bug 6 is the headline.** `py_compile` misses runtime symbol errors. Geometry tests don't import the controller module. Smoke test written to catch this class of bug.

**P2.4 realistic gain:** ~20mm at 0.4 m/s (= pose_age × v), NOT the 30-40mm originally claimed with acceleration integration. Phase C performance numbers in this historical entry were predictions until bench/field data.

**Current runtime correction:** `/rpp/yaw_setpoint_ned` is gone. `twist_to_setpoint_node.py` computes explicit yaw from `/rpp/velocity_ned` and conditionally includes fresh non-zero `/rpp/yaw_rate_body` in PositionTarget (`455` with yaw_rate, `2503` without).

### Runtime smoke test added
- `test_smoke_rpp_controller.py` — instantiates `RPPControllerNode` with rclpy, ticks `_control_loop` once with mocked subscribers, tests `_publish_zero`, `_publish_yaw_rate`, and the MAVROS ENU→NED pose boundary. Would have caught Bug 6 in 30 seconds. Must run on Jetson (requires ROS2).

### Next
- **Phase A: Hardware validation** — flash 617cce5a, bench-verify motor direction, cold-boot test, OFFBOARD straight-line test, verify FIFO grant (`chrt -p`), audit twist_to_setpoint_node.py
- **Phase D: Production hardening** — remove ROVER_DISABLE_AUTH, sd_notify, pytest suite, QGC origin re-anchor
- **Doc corrections** — superseded by later source-code audit notes; do not use this historical "Next" list as the active tracker.

## 2026-05-25 — PX.4_DXp React Native frontend, Tasks 1–10 + production review (1 session)

### Built
- **Tasks 1–2 (scaffold + stores):** Expo SDK 56 / RN 0.85 / TypeScript strict / Zustand. Expo Router with 5 tabs (home/map/draw/drive/more), theme (colors/spacing/typography), telemetry/mission/socket type definitions, all 5 Zustand stores (connection, telemetry, mission, UI, DXF), `useRover()` composing hook.
- **Tasks 3–5 (services + dashboard):** `services/api.ts` typed REST client, `services/socket.ts` Socket.IO bridge with every server event wired to stores. Dashboard with RoverHeroCard (live SVG path trace + heading-rotated icon), ConnectionBadge, EmergencyOverlay, QuickActions, SysDiagnostics. UI primitives (Card/Btn/Pill/Dot/Bar/Stat/SectionHeader/AppBar/IconBtn) + 60+ SVG icons.
- **Tasks 6–10 (all screens):** Connect (3-step scan→connecting→done with real socket-event waiter), Drive (AttitudeIndicator + HeadingDisc + gesture-handler Joystick + motor monitor + e-stop), Map (`react-native-maps` with long-press waypoint add, draggable markers, type inspector, telemetry chip), Draw (DXF/Gallery/SVG/Draw/G-code tabs, finger-drawing canvas with throttled SVG render), More + 8 sub-screens (settings/ros-nodes/px4-params/calibrate/logs/fleet/firmware/camera).

### Fixed (commits `3fc25aa` + `4ed5521`)
20-item production code review + 4-item backend contract mismatch review, all addressed:

**Safety / correctness (Critical):**
- E-Stop button now calls `api.estop()` before flipping local UI state (was: local-only, lying about hardware state).
- Arm button no longer flips UI to "armed" on backend failure (was: `catch { setArmed(!armed) }`).
- `handleHold` now calls `api.stopMission()` — server has no `Hold` mode, only `MANUAL`/`OFFBOARD`.
- `rover_disconnected` socket event wired (server emits this when FCU heartbeat drops while socket stays up; was deaf).
- Connect flow waits for real Socket.IO `connect` event with 10 s timeout (was: 1.2 s sleep then unconditional "success").
- Socket teardown on URL change (was: cached socket kept talking to old rover).
- Telemetry store assigns every field; no `as any` cast; mode strings mapped through `mapPx4Mode()` table.
- `TelemetryData` interface now optional for fields the server doesn't emit (`current/temp/hdop/rssi/roll/pitch/motor`) + added fields the server DOES emit (`lat/lon/pos_n/pos_e/xtrack_m/dist_to_goal_m/...`).
- `GPS_FIX_LABELS` now `Partial<Record<...>>` with keys 0–8, RTK_FIXED at 6 (newer MAVROS).

**Reliability (High):**
- `AbortSignal.timeout()` on every fetch (5 s default, 1.5 s on estop).
- Socket reconnection: `Infinity` attempts, 30 s cap. Manual `Reconnect` button in ConnectionBadge.
- Joystick: `disabledSV` shared value short-circuits onUpdate on UI thread when prop flips mid-gesture; `runOnJS` throttled to 30 Hz.
- DrawCanvas: live stroke in ref, React state only updated on `onEnd` + 30 Hz; no per-frame SVG rebuild.
- Map markers: `tracksViewChanges={false}` to stop full-redraw thrash on telemetry tick.
- RoverHeroCard: real `activeRoverUrl` instead of "Studio A"; "—" for fields not yet populated instead of Boston coordinate.
- `mission_status` progress uses real `total_distance` when sent, fallback to `job.paths` (no more `/20` magic).
- `arm_result` / `mode_result` `message` field surfaced to `backendError` + log buffer on failure.

**Quality of life:**
- `_layout.tsx` cancelled-flag prevents init/cleanup race.
- Waypoint IDs use a monotonic counter (no `Date.now()` collision risk).
- Structured `errorLog` ring buffer (200 entries) in `useUiStore`; `logs.tsx` consumes it with auto-scroll.
- `setToken` async/awaited; AsyncStorage errors no longer fire-and-forget.

**Tooling blockers:**
- `babel.config.js` created with `react-native-reanimated/plugin` (re-export still works in Reanimated 4).
- `npm run tsc` script wired (`tsc --noEmit`). Exits 0.

### Outstanding (not done, deliberate)
- `app.json` Google Maps API key still a placeholder — release-build blocker.
- Real UDP rover discovery needs `react-native-udp` install + native rebuild. Today's REST `/api/discover` is theatre (returns *other* rovers on the LAN, not itself).
- Backend extensions to emit `roll/pitch/motor[]/current/temp/hdop/rssi` — UI tolerates absence, will show real values once the Jetson side adds them.
- `MissionMode` kept as Title-case display abstraction (`Manual/Hold/Draw/Mission`) mapped from raw PX4 strings via `mapPx4Mode()` — defensible, not a bug.

### Lessons
- A prior-turn claim of "all fixed, tsc clean" missed 5 contract bugs. `tsc --noEmit` exit 0 is necessary, not sufficient — types can be internally consistent and still lie. Saved as feedback memory: `feedback_verify_dont_trust_narration`.
- Frontend↔backend wire details (auth header, mode enum, telemetry shape, event names) captured in `reference_frontend_backend_contract` to avoid re-deriving on the next change.

### Next
- Wire Joystick `onChange` to a `/api/cmd_vel` endpoint (need backend route).
- Add real Google Maps API key + EAS secret pipeline.
- Backend extension to emit attitude (roll/pitch from IMU) + motor PWMs.
- Smoke test on physical Android tablet + Jetson backend.
