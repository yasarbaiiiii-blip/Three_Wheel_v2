What this node does
-------------------
- Subscribes to a path of waypoints in LOCAL_NED.
- Subscribes to /mavros/local_position/pose (ENU; converted to NED on read).
- Subscribes to /mavros/gpsstatus/gps1/raw for RTK fix gating (P0.3).
- Computes a Regulated Pure Pursuit (RPP) lookahead point on the path.
- Outputs a NED velocity *vector* (not body-frame Twist).

Sprint 1 upgrades vs baseline
------------------------------
  P0.1  Closed-loop L_d: uses last commanded speed → lookahead_time param
        is now live (was dead constant before).
  P0.2  EKF / RTK jump detection: position jumps > physically-possible motion
        pause one control cycle and do not inject a spike into the controller.
  P0.3  RTK FIX gate: refuses to command non-zero velocity unless GPS
        fix_type = 6 (RTK_FIXED). Gated by `require_rtk_fix` parameter so
        SITL / non-RTK testing still works.
  P1.4  Segment search hint (_closest_seg_hint): projection search starts from
        the previous closest segment instead of i=0 every cycle. O(1) in
        steady state instead of O(n).

Sprint 2 upgrades vs Sprint 1
------------------------------
  P1.1  Predictive curvature regulation: speed scaling now uses the worst κ
        across N preview points along the path (path-intrinsic Menger
        curvature), not just at the lookahead point. The rover anticipates
        corners and slows BEFORE entering them. This is the single biggest
        geometric advantage over textbook Pure Pursuit.
  P1.2  Adaptive lookahead: L_d = clamp(k_v·v + k_e·|e_⊥|, L_min, L_max).
        On-path → tight lookahead → tight tracking. Off-path → longer
        lookahead → smooth re-acquisition without overshoot.
  P1.3  Path conditioning on receipt (both opt-in, default OFF for marking):
        - path_resample_spacing_m > 0: linear resample to uniform spacing.
          Preserves geometry exactly; densifies sparse polylines so
          predictive κ has more samples.
        - corner_smooth_radius_m > 0: replace interior vertices with
          inscribed circular arcs of the given radius. Bounds path
          curvature at κ_max = 1/r. Skips vertices where adjacent segments
          are too short to support the radius.

Phase D / P4.1–P4.2 — dynamics-aware speed control
-----------------------------------------------------
  P4.1  Lateral acceleration constraint: speed = min(max_v, sqrt(a_lat_max/|κ|)),
        floored at regulated_linear_scaling_min_speed. Replaces the old linear
        R/min_radius scaling with the physically correct form. At a_lat_max=0.3:
        straight→1.0 m/s, R=1m→0.55 m/s, R=0.5m→0.39 m/s, R=0.3m→0.30 m/s.
        Tune a_lat_max; the old regulated_linear_scaling_min_radius is removed.
  P4.2  Mission speed — single operator knob (ros2 param set mission_speed X.X).
        max_linear_vel is the hardware ceiling (never touch per-job).
        mission_speed is what you set per job: 1.0 for roads, 0.4 for fields.
        approach_velocity_scaling_dist and ekf_jump_threshold_m auto-derive from
        mission_speed at runtime (physics: d=v²/2a, thr=v/Hz+σ_RTK). The
        configured param values act as floors — never silently undersized.

Phase C / P3.1 — opt-in upgrades (default OFF for backward compat)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  P0.5  REMOVED 2026-05-23: yaw is now computed in twist_to_setpoint_node from
        the velocity vector (atan2(v_n, v_e)). No separate /rpp/yaw_setpoint_ned
        topic needed. RPP still computes yaw_target internally for _last_yaw_cmd
        state, but no longer publishes it.
  P2.4  Velocity-based pose extrapolation (latency closure): when on,
        dead-reckon `pose_for_projection = pose + vel_ned · pose_age` using
        /mavros/local_position/velocity_local (already EKF-clean and gravity-
        compensated). The pose freshness budget extends by
        imu_max_extrap_age_s so a 50-150 ms MAVROS gap stays usable instead
        of tripping STALE. We deliberately omit the 0.5·a·dt² term: it's
        sub-mm at typical bench accelerations and pulling raw IMU `a` would
        leak gravity bias through any non-zero pitch/roll.
  P3.1  Feedforward yaw rate: publishes /rpp/yaw_rate_body (Float32) with
        ω = κ·v + k_ψ·θ_e for body-rate OFFBOARD mode. Bypasses PX4 spot-turn
        FSM for smoother corners. Requires twist_to_setpoint_node to forward
        the rate.

What this node does NOT do
--------------------------
- Does NOT (by default) compute angular velocity ω. PX4 v1.16+ ignores
  yawspeed in the OFFBOARD velocity branch and derives target yaw from
  atan2(vE, vN) of the velocity vector. P3.1 publishes ω opt-in for the
  body-rate path; the velocity path is unchanged.
- Does NOT implement rotate-to-heading. PX4's spot-turn FSM does this
  automatically; tune RD_TRANS_DRV_TRN (≈30°) and RD_TRANS_TRN_DRV (≈5°).
- Does NOT do body→NED rotation of pose. Output is already in NED.

Output contract
---------------
Topic:  /rpp/velocity_ned   (geometry_msgs/Vector3Stamped)
        header.stamp     = now
        header.frame_id  = "local_ned"
        vector.x         = v_north  (m/s, NED North)
        vector.y         = v_east   (m/s, NED East)
        vector.z         = 0.0

When the path is complete, the velocity vector is exactly (0, 0, 0) and yaw is frozen.
PX4's P4 patch detects |v| < 1 cm/s and freezes heading instead of snapping to North.

When pose is stale or missing, an emergency-stop (0, 0, 0) is published at
50 Hz so OFFBOARD does not drop (COM_OF_LOSS_T = 500 ms).

Frame conventions
-----------------
- Path poses are in LOCAL_NED (x = North, y = East, z = Down).
- /mavros/local_position/pose is in ENU (x = East, y = North, z = Up) per
  MAVROS REP-103. We swap x↔y on read to get NED.
- Yaw is converted from ENU quaternion to NED yaw on read.
- All math after the pose-input boundary is NED.

        it survives run-splitting as its own pivot target, and the remaining
        leg turn then falls below segment_corner_threshold_deg, so the real leg
        is entered un-pivoted (the triangle-apex-2 failure).

        A segment between simplified corner vertices V[i]→V[i+1] is absorbed
        when ALL hold:
          * its length < connector_absorb_m, and
          * it is *interior* (a real leg exists on each side), and

            min_corner_deg.
        The two endpoints are replaced by the *intersection of the two adjacent
        leg lines* — the true apex the doubled waypoints approximate — so both
        legs keep their original headings (a plain midpoint sits off the leg
        lines when the connector is lateral, bending the corner and leaving a
        residual stub). If the legs are near-parallel or the intersection lands
        implausibly far away, the midpoint is used as a safe fallback. The merge
        vertex inherits the connector's flag, so mark/transit semantics hold.

        The dual-corner gate is what protects a *real* short MARK stroke: a
        deliberate short entity is not bracketed by two hard corners (it is
        collinear-ish with, or flag-bounded from, its neighbours), so it is left
